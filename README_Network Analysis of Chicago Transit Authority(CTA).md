**About CTA:**

The Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) stands as a monumental figure in the realm of public transportation, boasting the second largest system in the United States. On any given weekday, an astounding 1.6 million rides are embarked upon within the network of the CTA, making it a prime subject for detailed examination.

**Datasets:**
Contained within this repository is the Excel file named `CTA.xlsx` in the zip folder named [My Network Analysis of Chicago Transit Authority (CTA).zip](https://github.com/saisadhan/Flight-Delays-Visualization-Dashboard/blob/main/Network%20Analysis%20of%20Chicago%20Transit%20Authority%20(CTA).zip), housing a trove of data pertinent to the train routes operating within Chicago. This dataset comprises crucial fields including:

- **LineName:** Unique identifiers for each train line.
- **LineID:** Distinctive IDs assigned to individual train lines.
- **Order of Stations:** Sequential arrangement of stations along a given route.
- **StationName:** Names of stations within the network.
- **Latitude and Longitude:** Geographical coordinates of each station.
- **ADA Accessible:** An indicator denoting station accessibility for individuals with disabilities.

**Steps to Creation:**
In crafting the departure dashboard, a meticulous process was undertaken to ensure clarity, accuracy, and comprehensiveness. Here's a glimpse into the methodology:

1. **Mapping Stations:**
   - A visually immersive map was designed to depict all stations (or nodes) within the CTA network.
   - This map is embellished with three distinct layers: Base, Land Cover, and Streets, Highways, and Routes, providing context and depth to the visualization.

2. **Route Representation:**
   - Complementing the station nodes, lines representing train routes were incorporated into the visualization.
   - This addition not only completes the node-link diagram but also facilitates a clearer understanding of the connectivity and layout of the CTA system.

**Why Explore This Dashboard?**
The Network Analysis of CTA holds immense value for a myriad of stakeholders, including urban planners, transportation authorities, and commuters alike. By unraveling the intricacies of the CTA network, this dashboard offers profound insights into commuter patterns, accessibility dynamics, and potential areas for optimization and enhancement.
