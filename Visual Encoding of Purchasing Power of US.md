Welcome to the repository housing the data visualization dashboard focused on analyzing the purchasing power across different states in the United States. This visualization is inspired by the New York Times article titled "What $100 Can Buy, State by State," published on August 8, 2016. The primary goal of this dashboard is to provide users with an insightful and interactive experience to explore and understand the purchasing power disparity across various regions.

**Data Source:**

The data utilized for this visualization is sourced from the New York Times article and is stored in the PurchasingPower.xlsx spreadsheet. It consists of two main fields: State and PP (Purchasing Power), which is calculated based on regional price parity data obtained from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The national average purchasing power is set at $100.

**Key Features of the Dashboard:**

1. **Transformation of Quantitative Data:**
   The initial step in creating this dashboard involved transforming the quantitative data of purchasing power (PP) into categorical data. This transformation aids in presenting the information in a more digestible and visually appealing format.

2. **Enhanced Color Encoding:**
   Originally, the dashboard depicted the purchasing power with two distinct green intensities, making it challenging to discern which states fell above or below the national average of $100. To address this issue, I implemented a continuous color scale, utilizing red and green hues to signify states below and above the national average, respectively.

3. **Interactive Visualization:**
   The dashboard offers an interactive interface, allowing users to dynamically explore the purchasing power of different states. Users can hover over specific regions to view detailed information, facilitating a deeper understanding of the data.

**Why This Visualization Matters:**

Understanding regional purchasing power disparities is crucial for policymakers, economists, businesses, and individuals alike. By visualizing this data, I aim to shed light on economic inequalities and empower informed decision-making at various levels. Whether it's understanding the cost of living in different states or identifying areas for economic intervention, this visualization serves as a valuable tool for analysis and exploration.

**Contributions and Feedback:**

I welcome contributions and feedback from the community to enhance and refine this visualization further. Whether it's suggesting improvements, identifying data inaccuracies, or sharing insights gained from the dashboard, your input is highly valued. Together, we can continue to iterate and improve this visualization to better serve its purpose.

Thank you for exploring my Purchasing Power Visualization Dashboard. I hope you find it insightful and valuable in your endeavors. Happy exploring!
